# Life Bank - Virtual Blood Bank

Welcome to Life Bank, a virtual blood bank web application designed to connect blood donors with individuals in need. This project aims to make the process of blood donation more accessible and efficient, helping save lives in critical situations.


## Introduction

In many emergency situations, finding the right blood type and donor can be a challenging task. Life Bank solves this problem by providing a user-friendly platform for both blood donors and recipients. Donors can easily register and specify their blood type, while recipients can search for donors in their area and request assistance. This project aims to bridge the gap between those willing to donate blood and those in urgent need.
